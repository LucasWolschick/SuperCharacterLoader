## Installing
You can install this plugin by getting it [directly from Roblox](https://www.roblox.com/library/6218794065/Super-Character-Loader) or by running `rojo build -o SuperCharacterLoader.rbxmx` and copying the file into your Plugins folder (`%LOCALAPPDATA%\Roblox\Plugins` on Windows).

## Why?
Many reasons! I originally made this project to get myself some experience with the Roblox plugin API, and as a free, open source alternative to a popular paid plugin made by another user on the platform.
